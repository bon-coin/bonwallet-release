## Important!

### Wallets with Masternodes
<p><b>Please DO NOT USE this application in wallets with Masternodes. For now we did not implement coin control and you can not lock UTXOs.</b></p>

### Syscoin Core is required
<p>Wallet works with Syscoin Core and you need to install Core version with <b>syscoind</b> file inside. Download it <a href="https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin">here</a>!</p>

### Reindexing to build local asset index
<p>If you previously launched syscoind without assetindex=1 in syscoin.conf, use wallet option  <b>"Launch Core with reindex"</b> during first wallet launch.</p>

### Separate Wallet
<p>We strongly suggest creating two separate wallets, one strictly for SYS, and the other for tokens with a smaller amount of SYS for transaction fees. This eliminates confusion and headaches related to coin control with tokens. </p>
